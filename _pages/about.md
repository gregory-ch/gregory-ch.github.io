Hello. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in designing laboratory experiments. Now I work as a guest researcher at [University of Tuebingen, Department of Computer Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/decision-making/). I study experimental economics methodology, with a focus on joint causal inference and interventional causal discovery. My substantive interests include understanding subjects' information exchange during repeated interactions (see the [thesis](https://www.hse.ru/data/xf/990/505/1457/Чернов_диссертация.pdf)), like understanding dynamics bids changing and forming beliefs about opponents. 

You might be interested in our [python version of R package for computing asymmetric Shapley values to assess causality in any trained machine learning model](https://pypi.org/project/shapflex/?fbclid=IwAR0zQbnK7whnnzJBAg-vT_il_EWq8hgVd5M0ItZHvWViOJMVKgQ9Q-Flq5E), with working example of using [here](https://github.com/gregory-ch/shap_flex_porting/blob/main/shap_joint.ipynb?fbclid=IwAR2udEr0EKQaZokTuXonnGtxfTRRVQIdGnKwJ6MzPYUG0rY-oEtSWdhZsg8).
