Hello. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in designing laboratory experiments. . Now I work as a guest researcher at [University of Tuebingen, Department of Computer Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/decision-making/). I study experimental economics methodology, with a focus on joint causal inference and interventional causal discoveryovery. My substantive interests include understanding subjects' information exchange during repeated interactions, like understanding dynamics bids changing and forming beliefs about opponents. 

You might be interested in our [python version of R package for computing asymmetric Shapley values to assess causality in any trained machine learning model](https://pypi.org/project/shapflex/?fbclid=IwAR0zQbnK7whnnzJBAg-vT_il_EWq8hgVd5M0ItZHvWViOJMVKgQ9Q-Flq5E), with working example of using [here](https://github.com/gregory-ch/shap_flex_porting/blob/main/shap_joint.ipynb?fbclid=IwAR2udEr0EKQaZokTuXonnGtxfTRRVQIdGnKwJ6MzPYUG0rY-oEtSWdhZsg8).
