Hello. I am a behavioral scientist around 30 y.o. Now I work as a guest researcher at [University of Tuebingen, Department of Computer Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/decision-making/) I study experimental economics methodology, with a focus on joint causal inference and interventional causal discoveryovery. My substantive interests include the extracting information by the subjects during repeatetive interactions, like understanding of dymaics bids changing and forming the beliefs about opponent.
