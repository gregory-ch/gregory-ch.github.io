Hello. 
Behavioral scientist and applied researcher working at inDrive’s Marketplace Efficiency Cluster.
Previously at UCL Department of Economics, Max Planck Institute, and HSE University.

Interested in experiments  (as example see the [thesis](https://www.hse.ru/data/xf/990/505/1457/Чернов_диссертация.pdf)), causal inference (see lib description below), and marketplace optimization.


You might be interested in our [python version of R package for computing asymmetric Shapley values to assess causality in any trained machine learning model](https://pypi.org/project/shapflex/?fbclid=IwAR0zQbnK7whnnzJBAg-vT_il_EWq8hgVd5M0ItZHvWViOJMVKgQ9Q-Flq5E), with working example of using [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/gregory-ch/shap_flex_porting/blob/main/shap_joint.ipynb).
