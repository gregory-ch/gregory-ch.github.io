<p>Back in the day, Ron Kohavi dedicated a good portion of his book to the culture of experimentation within companies — something halfway between corporate training and a set of empirical recipes. At that time, a full-fledged culture of causal inference had yet to emerge: there was neither a solid theoretical foundation nor real-world cases beyond traditional experiments.</p>

<p>The theoretical groundwork was laid by Schölkopf’s student, <strong>Sarah Magliken</strong>. In her work (JMLR, 2020, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v21/17-123.html">link</a>), she and colleagues from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab proposed a universal methodology that allows the integration of heterogeneous data into a unified ontological system for causal analysis.</p>

<h2 id="ubers-journey-to-causal-inference">Uber’s Journey to Causal Inference</h2>

<p>Today, many companies strive to build a culture of causal inference: Causal Lens, Amazon, Zalando — all embracing this methodology. However, Uber was one of the first to articulate this as a core cultural principle. In 2019, they detailed their approach in a <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/causal-inference-at-uber/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Uber actively applies causal inference to decision-making, going beyond classical A/B testing. The key aspects of their approach include:</p>

<p>🔹 <strong>Experiments as a standard</strong>, but with awareness of real-world constraints. Uber uses causal analysis to account for violations of test conditions, effect heterogeneity, and external influences.
🔹 <strong>Analysis beyond experiments.</strong> The company develops methods to evaluate causal relationships even in situations where running an experiment is impossible.
🔹 <strong>Causal inference as a strategic development tool.</strong> Understanding causes—not just correlations—enables Uber to enhance user experience and improve operational efficiency.</p>

<p>Thus, at Uber, causal inference is not just analytics; it is a fundamental principle of data-driven decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="the-evolution-of-causal-inference-since-2019">The Evolution of Causal Inference Since 2019</h2>

<p>Since 2019, significant changes have reshaped the landscape of causal inference, not only expanding the toolkit but also strengthening the structural approach to data analysis. Here are some key areas of progress:</p>

<p>🔹 <strong>Balancing Techniques</strong> – Modern methods like matching, IP weighting, Double Robust Estimator, and others allow for handling <em>conditional exchangeability</em>, effectively mimicking interventions.
<a href="https://youtu.be/Kx6W-Jq3OWE?si=gtIb6XjFZSQBdbGE">Watch more here</a></p>

<p>🔹 <strong>Optimal Experiments with Non-Additive Effects</strong> – In real-world scenarios, interactions between variables are rarely additive. New methods enable accounting for combinations of effects.

<p>🔹 <strong>Causal Discovery and Time Series Causal Discovery</strong> – Automated detection of causal relationships, especially in time-series data, is becoming a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems.

<p>But most importantly, causal inference is no longer just a set of tools. It’s a way of working with counterfactual scenarios, conducting detailed data analysis, and understanding the limitations of each method. CI is a culture, not just a recipe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chernov Gregory</name></author><category term="eng" /><category term="causality" /><category term="CausalInference" /><category term="Uber" /><category term="data science" /><category term="MachineLearning" /><category term="Experiments" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foundations of Causal Inference]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fresh Example of Simpson’s Paradox in Clinical Trials</title><link href="https://gregory-ch.github.io/posts/2024/06/simpson-paradox/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fresh Example of Simpson’s Paradox in Clinical Trials" /><published>2024-06-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://gregory-ch.github.io/posts/2024/06/simpson-paradox</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gregory-ch.github.io/posts/2024/06/simpson-paradox/"><![CDATA[<p>A fresh example of Simpson’s Paradox in the wild has recently <a href="https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/the-nih-doesnt-fund-small-crappy">emerged</a>!

<p>Data from ClinicalTrials.gov shows that the median number of participants in NIH-funded trials is 48, compared to 67 in industry trials and 923 in other trials (mostly university-based). However, when trials are divided by phase, it turns out that the NIH funds the most Phase I trials, yet in each phase, their trials have the highest or second-highest number of participants.</p>

<p>Therefore, the data suggests that fewer NIH-funded trials reach Phase III. This could be due to various reasons: perhaps the NIH selects studies more carefully or only works with strong evidence requiring less time to reach Phase III. It’s important to note that the issue of “small, crappy trials” doesn’t stand out in either case.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chernov Gregory</name></author><category term="eng" /><category term="causality" /><category term="simpson-paradox" /><category term="statistics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh example of Simpson’s Paradox in the wild has recently emerged!

Having read several chapters in detail and skimmed through the rest, here’s my take on it.</p>

<h3 id="strengths">Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Core Structure</strong>: The narrative begins with a general formulation that enables comparison of different identification strategies (graphical, balancing, experimental, and structural)</li>
  <li><strong>Notation</strong>: Many topics are consolidated with relatively consistent notation (e.g., double robust methods are compared with conditional ignorability)</li>
  <li><strong>Topic Coverage</strong>: Includes numerous deep topics (e.g., connection of regression and treatment effects)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Layout</strong>: The narrative template, borrowed from <a href="https://lnkd.in/eZq8CXjk">this source</a>, originally used a blogging logic with numerous notes and examples. However, in a technical manual, this approach feels redundant</li>
  <li><strong>Narrative Imbalance</strong>: The division between advanced and general topics often seems arbitrary. Many explanations are omitted, the sequence feels random for newcomers, and the separation of predictive and causal methods appears as ax ante without proper justification</li>
  <li><strong>Unexplained Terms</strong>: Several concepts (like Neyman Orthogonality) are treated as common knowledge when they’re not, and there are many such instances throughout the book</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="verdict">Verdict:</h3>
<p>This book isn’t suitable for beginners (and probably not for second-time learners either). Its main strength lies in attempting to bridge CS and Economics audiences while searching for universals. I plan to use it as a reference for specific cases and as a source for keywords and citations to original works. I hope it will provide economists with better insight into the CS perspective, which has historically treated the topic somewhat <a href="https://lnkd.in/ewDbJE9a">superficially</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chernov Gregory</name></author><category term="eng" /><category term="causality" /><category term="textbooks" /><category term="causal-ml-book" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Twitter/X, there’s been a lot of discussion about Chernozhukov’s textbook, which came out on February 24th.

<p>So I was surprised to find at one of the <a href="https://lnkd.in/eq8YTnK4">conferences</a> a plausible alternative approach, which the authors themselves call “Causal probabilistic programming without tears”. Unlike learners, this py-library allows you to customize a lot of things related to estimation and tests and control the process to a much greater extent, so for anyone with an econometric or statistical background I highly recommend it.</p>

Among the trends this year, it is worth noting that, unlike in previous years, there are more and more papers on methods directly working in or being developed for production environments.</p>

<p>For example, a recently published <a href="https://lnkd.in/dvwCMrTt">keynote</a> is devoted to how Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is applied in AMAZON. I was able to ask the speaker a question and he agreed with my assessment that augmented models will be one of the growth drivers in the next 5 years.</p>

<p>The growing interest in causal libraries (especially Microsoft’s) also testifies to the penetration of the methods into the practices of European companies. It seems that the idea that treatment effect estimates are more robust to changes in the input distributions (varying with time or circumstances) is penetrating more deeply.</p>

<p>Among other notable presentations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A talk about Causal Bandits from DeepMind</li>
  <li>A presentation by Duda and Hornof (Dresden lab) showing that structural estimates, or MLs based on them, show more frequent evidence of higher precision than BlackBox models</li>
</ul>

<p>For those interested in previous meetings, I recommend checking out <a href="https://lnkd.in/dUuqEEjr">this blog</a> summarizing the results from previous years. It contains various interesting materials, and for those involved in demand analysis, I particularly recommend looking at the 2022 competition from Zalando, especially the winning models.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chernov Gregory</name></author><category term="eng" /><category term="causality" /><category term="conferences" /><category term="data science" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not so long ago, the third annual Causal Data Science Meeting was held on November 7-8.

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: В этой популярной книге Дэн Ариели показал широкой аудитории, что мы гораздо дальше от рациональности, чем предполагает классическая экономическая теория. Более того, наше иррациональное поведение не является случайным или бессмысленным. Оно является систематическим и (поскольку мы повторяем его вновь и вновь) предсказуемым. Книга позволяет широкому кругу читателей на множестве примеров, отлично подобранных автором, познакомиться с тем, как именно эвристики и когнитивные искажения влияют на экономические институты и на повседневное поведение каждого из нас.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: Книга продолжает серию научно-популярных работ Дэна Ариели, написанных в традиционном для него лаконичном и ясном стиле, что делает ее легко доступной даже для неподготовленного читателя. В ней он продолжает знакомить широкую аудиторию с экспериментальными работами, которые посвящены изучению решений и отклонений от нормативного поведения, но делает акцент на возможности использования знаний поведенческой экономики для позитивных изменений поведения.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong></p>

<p>Репутация Дена Ариели серьёзно пошатнулась после инцидента с фальсификацией данных статьи 2012 года о нечестности, которая вскрылась в 21 году. Есть явные свидетельства фабрикации данных, что может быть результатом как нечестности самого Ариели, так и компании, которая предоставила данные. Как писал об этом инциденте Форбс (https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2021/08/30/an-influential-study-of-dishonesty-was-dishonest/) если выяснится, что это всё-таки Ариели: “Then he would be dishonest in his coverup of his dishonesty in a study of dishonesty!”. На текущий момент уже Science, поставило под сомнение ряд других исследований автора (<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fraudulent-data-set-raise-questions-about-superstar-honesty-researcher">https://www.science.org/content/article/fraudulent-data-set-raise-questions-about-superstar-honesty-researcher</a>). Более недавняя история, произошла с одной из соавторок Дана <a href="https://datacolada.org/109">https://datacolada.org/109</a> .</p>

<p>Мой субъективный взгляд говорит о том, что ко всему написанному в связи с этим стоит относится с высокой долей скептицизма. Чем больше в работах storytelling, и чем меньше по ним опубликованных данных и воспроизведённых работ, тем меньше им стоит доверять.</p>

  <li>Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, fast and slow. Macmillan, 2011. Рус. пер. Канеман, Д. “Думай медленно… решай быстро, АСТ.  2014.</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: Несколько лет назад на небольшой конференции в Тегеране посвященной нейрофилософии, произошла занимательная история. В числе приглашенных выдающихся исследователей человеческого познания, была Энн Трейсман, ведущий американский специалист в области психологии внимания, и мать известного политолога-специалиста по России Дэниела Трейсмана. В один из дней, когда участники конференции сидели в кафе, кто-то по неведению спросил Энн: «Скажите, а чем занимается ваш муж?» «Тратит Нобелевскую премию», – к изумлению спросившего ответила Энн. Речь шла о Даниэле Канемане, который в то время как раз писал эту книгу. Нобелевская премия Канемана – для психологии вещь невиданная. Да и вручена она была за заслуги в области экономики, поскольку работы Канемана выходят за пределы собственно психологического знания и отвечают на вопрос о том, почему и как мы ошибаемся, делая выбор и принимая решения, в том числе экономические, в том числе на государственном уровне. По большому счету книга «Думай медленно… Решай быстро» – подробная и доступная разработка идей, прозвучавших в Нобелевской лекции и выросших из исследований, которые Канеман начал более 40 лет назад совместно с Амосом Тверски. В этой удостоенной множества престижных наград книге автор не только подводит итоги исследований, но и дает практические рекомендации относительно того, когда мы вполне можем себе доверять, а когда лучше задуматься, остановиться и перепроверить свои выводы. «Думай медленно… Решай быстро» – яркий пример того, как когнитивные исследования проникают в самые разные сферы жизни, начиная от заключения деловых контрактов и заканчивая личными отношениями. (Из рецензии М. Фаликман)</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong></p>

<p>TFS, на мой взгляд, всё еще лучшее на рынке введения в литературу по эвристикам и предубеждениям, но с одной оговоркой. Она была написана в 2011 году и с того времени кризис воспроизводимости стал гораздо более заметным явлением, так что часть стандартов изменилась, а часть результатов подверглась проверке. Существенные претензии обнаружились только к главе 4, основанной на исследованиях прайминга, однако не так много результатов эту проверку непосредственно прошли (хотя некоторые, например теория перспектив, были воспроизведены феноменальное количество раз и стали почти стандартным упражнением в классах по поведенческой экономике). Принимая всё это, рекомендую перед прочтением внимательно изучить опасения исследователей (например <a href="https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/">https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/</a>) и, уже соотнося их с главами и оценочной достоверностью, приступать к чтению.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: Книга является одной из первых попыток познакомить широкого читателя с методикой исследования социальных процессов и применимостью экономических моделей в самых неожиданных областях — как новых (борьба сумо), так и заново открытых для широкой публики (лингвистика), но неизменно ярких и запоминающихся. Несмотря на то, что книга вызвала активную дискуссию среди профессиональных экономистов, (чего только стоит комментарий Ариеля Рубинштейна об «отсутствия связей с экономикой» и «Академическом Империализме»), данная работа обязательна к прочтению всем, кому интересны «необычные стороны обычных явлений».</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong></p>

  <li>Lewis, Michael. The undoing project: A friendship that changed our minds. WW Norton &amp; Company, 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: За год до вручения Нобелевской премии Ричарду Талеру за понимание того, какую роль психология играет в экономике, Майкл Льюис пишет биографическую книгу The Undoing Project. («Отмененный проект: дружба, которая изменила наш разум», на русском не издавалась). Книга была опубликована 6 декабря 2016 года и уже стала бестселлером по версии авторитетного издания о книгах 800CEOREAD, а также получила более 200 положительных отзывов на сайте Amazon и полторы тысячи положительных оценок на книжном портале GoodReads.</p>

<p>Майкл Льюис является признанным мастером нон-фикшена в области финансовой журналистики и автором таких супер-бестселлеров, как «Покер лжецов», «Moneyball» («Человек, который изменил все»), «Игра на понижение». Написанная в непревзойденной авторской манере своего рода интеллектуальная биография двух ученых-психологов ― нобелиата Даниэля Канемана и его друга и коллеги Амоса Тверски, знакомит читателя с историей зарождения поведенческой экономики и теории перспектив.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong> Биографический жанр во много выигрывает от формата изложения, если речь заходит о сложных материях. На мой субъективный взгляд, в книге дан неплохой портрет современной инертности академии, хотя вряд ли она может похвастаться той полнотой изложения, которая характерна для исторических книг (например за авторством Питера Бернстайна, “Против богов…”).</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: За одно только последнее десятилетие человечество пережило ряд тяжелейших катастроф, потрясений и катаклизмов, не укладывающихся в рамки самых фантастических предсказаний. Пятидесятидвухлетний ливанец, выпускник Сорбонны и нью-йоркский финансовый гуру Нассим Талеб называет такие непрогнозируемые события Черными лебедями. Он убежден: именно они дают толчок как истории в целом, так и существованию каждого отдельного человека. С момента публикации в 2007 году Черного Лебедя было продано 3 миллиона экземпляров, а сама книга была переведена на 32 языка и продержалась в списке бестселлеров Нью-Йорк Таймс 36 недель. Несмотря на кажущуюся простоту изложения, трудно переоценить её влияние на интеллектуалов всего мира. Так, например Дениель Канеман упоминал о «Черном Лебеде» как о книге «изменившей его взгляды на устройство мира», а сама концепция до сих пор остается предметом горячих обсуждений самого широкого круга специалистов из области финансов, наук об обществе и иных дисциплин.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий</strong> : Из академических кругов только ленивый не критиковал Талеба, и я думаю во многом из-за стилистики (уж больно вычурная для академии, да и много заигрывания с мистицизмом, на мой взгляд). По существу же, именно в этой книге нет ничего особенно нового, концепцию близкую к ней можно отследить уже в <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(foresight)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(foresight)</a>. Тем не менее, если вас (как и меня) мало интересуют взгляды Талеба на вселенную и история его рассуждений, рекомендую недописанную, но гораздо более осмысленную https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2001/2001.10488.pdf книгу, его же авторства. И хотя от авторского стиля избавиться не получится, рекомендую посмотреть на часть изложенных в книге рассуждений, с точки зрения <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_deviations_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_deviations_theory</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: Однажды Майкл Шермер - основатель Общества скептиков, сказал: «Умные люди верят в безумные вещи, потому что они способны искусно защищать свои убеждения, к которым пришли по не особо умным причинам». В своей книге Гари Бельски и Томас Гилович развивают эту идею на примере мира финансов, иллюстрируя её множеством примеров принятия решений, взятых из психологии. Книга посвящена решениям, которые мы принимаем каждый день, содержит множество полезных советов по предотвращению ошибок, которые без преувеличения могут стоить многие тысячи долларов.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong> Стоит отметить, что несмотря на то, что следить за ошибками других увлекательно, есть много свидетельств о том, что debiasing как таковой не очень работает. Там, где он действительно работает (например тут <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction</a> или тут <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto</a> ) можно выделить что: 1) люди почти не меняют свои склонности, но процедуры и протоколы могут исправить многое; 2) наблюдение за ошибками других редко даёт значимый эффект (а там где даёт, он очень мал).</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: На фоне становящейся все более и более популярной литературы об эвристиках и когнитивных искажениях, особняком стоит бестселлер по версии Нью-Йорк Таймс в 2015 году - «Суперпрогнозирование», написанный Филиппом Тетлоком и Дэном Гарднером. В отличие от большинства книг в этой области, посвященных изложению человеческих ошибок, авторы решили что нужно наконец измерить возможность им противостоять. И это не пустые слова: с 1984-го по 2003-й, на протяжении почти двадцати лет, авторы проводили эксперименты и собрали около 28 тысяч предсказаний от 284 экспертов, которые согласились поучаствовать на условиях анонимности. Результаты были неутешительными: в среднем эксперты предсказывали чуть лучше случайного угадывания. Однако существовала некоторая группа людей, которая демонстрировала результаты заметно лучше средних, что давало пищу для размышлений. Чтобы тщательнее изучить возможность увеличить способность к точному прогнозированию и преодолению когнитивных ошибок, было решено провести турнир по прогнозированию, в котором участвовало несколько исследовательских групп из известных университетов США. Результатам и практическим выводам и посвящена данная книга. Отдельно хочется отметить большое количество ссылок на оригиналы: ни одна цитата не остаётся без явного указания источника, даже если источником является личная переписка авторов.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong> Одна из самых воодушевляющих книг по поведенческой экономике, как обычно, написана по мотивам работ не экономистов: political scientist (Тетлок) и managment scientist (Меллерс). Выросшие из этих работ рынки прогнозирования заслуживают отдельного разбора. В целом, по-прежнему готов рекомендовать к прочтению данную книгу, кажется она ничуть не устарела. Тем, кто уже читал Канемана, рекомендую пропустить рассуждения о психологических предпосылках неверного прогнозирования и прочитать введение в метод (калибрация) и исторические очерки, а дальше лучше обратить внимание на их же <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/about/the-science-of-superforecasting/">https://goodjudgment.com/about/the-science-of-superforecasting/</a> и послушать подкасты с самим Тетлоком https://soundcloud.com/80000-hours/philip-tetlock-forecasting-research.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: С легкой руки авторов этой книги, концепция поведенческого подталкивания (Nudging) стала основой ряда конкретных предложений и мер общественной и частной политики. Талер среди поведенческих экономистов — первый среди равных, как по возрасту, так и по общим заслугам и авторитету. Неспроста именно он был экономическим советником бывшего президента США Б. Обамы. Так что его Нобелевская премия в 2017 году — это признание, как его собственных заслуг, так и вклада поведенческой экономики, как научной дисциплины, в понимание того, как мы принимаем решения. Эта книга основана на многолетних научных исследованиях авторов. Врач, менеджер, государственный служащий, собственник бизнеса, продавец, дизайнер, родитель (список можно продолжать) — все они являются архитекторами выбора и влияют на других людей. Книга Талера и Санстайна — сборник не просто кейсов, но и примеров того, как делать это эффективно.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong> Довольно много расхождений среди экономистов за что Талер в 2017 получил признание шведской королевской академии, поэтому выскажусь и сам. Мне кажется, что его подход содержит два безусловных достоинства. Во-первых, базовая метафора про архитектуру выбора достаточно хорошо сочетает экономическую интуицию неоклассических моделей и здравый смысл (хоть и менее формально чем в decision, но в нем хороших книг вообще нет). Во-вторых, упражнение, которое проделал Талер с пенсионными накоплениями по своему гениально. В поведенческое экономике состояние моделей довольно далеко о того, чтобы давать численный точный прогноз контрфактического состояния, но хорошие модели могут зафиксировать наличие и направление эффекта (например, в какую сторону человек недооценит/переоценить альтернативу, но не насколько). Однако таких моделей обычно недостаточно для policymaking. Талер предложил скомбинировать два эффекта (defaultoption и timediscounting), так чтобы их направленность совпадала. По отдельности их было бы недостаточно, но поскольку их направленность совпадает, они смогли поменять поведение существенного количества человек. У него это получилось и такой результат сложно было бы получить за счёт маркетинговых знаний или здравого смысла. Поэтому, на мой субъективный взгляд, для понимания именно поведенческой экономики и ее потенциальной пользы книга является неплохим введением. Вышла ещё и вторая книга (в ужасном переводе на рус.), но вместо неё рекомендовал бы напрямую читать порталы nudged юнитов Велибритании, Новой Зеландии и т.п. Сам подход архитектуры выбора не позволяет прогнозировать точную величину эффектов, но феномен того, что возможно складывать эффекты и понимать их направления в целом, я нахожу как очень позитивный.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: В книге нобелевского лауреата по экономике Джорджа Акерлофа и профессора Йельского университета Роберта Шиллера рассказывается об особенностях человеческого поведения, которые влияют на макроэкономические процессы. В прошлом эти особенности недостаточно учитывались теми, кто определяет экономическую политику государств, что приводило к более или менее серьезным финансовым проблемам - депрессиям, перегревам рынков и т.д. Хотя авторы описывают ряд сложных макроэкономических механизмов, в целом книга будет понятна самому широкому кругу читателей, потому что с этими свойствами человеческой психики каждый неоднократно сталкивался в повседневной жизни. (Из предисловия С. Гуриева)</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong> На сегодняшний день мне кажется, что книга морально устарела. Конечно посыл – давайте строить макромодели на более реалистичных предпосылках, заманчив. Тут стоит сказать, что и экономический взгляд на вопрос моделирования природных экономических систем усложнился (см далее книгу Kagel…) и уж тем более биологически/эволюционистский взгляд на поведение человека (очень рекомендую стенфордский курс <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqeYp3nxIYpF7dW7qK8OvLsVomHrnYNjD">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqeYp3nxIYpF7dW7qK8OvLsVomHrnYNjD</a>).</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: Почему мозг склонен обманывать сам себя? Каким образом физические и ментальные состояния влияют на воспринимаемую картину мира? Как работа мозга делает возможным обмен идеями между разными людьми? Этим и другим вопросам посвящена работа знаменитого британского физиолога Криса Фрита. Не совсем точный перевод названия «Мозг и душа» изданием Litres, не должен вводить читателя в заблуждение. Книга «Making up the mind» отнюдь не метафизична. Автор активно использует язык нейровизуализации, и открывает для читателя результаты своей лонгитюдной работы с пациентами и множества других экспериментальных исследований. Строгость, доступность и полнота изложения — вот отличительные черты этой книги.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: Каждый из нас - одновременно и биологическая машина в детерминированной вселенной, и целостный сознательный субъект, действующий в соответствии с собственными целями и обладающий свободой выбора. В своей книге “Кто за главного?” Майкл Газзанига - «отец» когнитивной нейронауки (который в 1970-х годах вместе со своим коллегой Джорджем Миллером на заднем сиденье нью-йоркского такси придумал сам термин “когнитивная нейронаука”), задаётся самыми интригующими и будоражащими сознание вопросами о границах свободы человеческого выбора. Он рассказывает, как благодаря исследованиям расщепленного мозга был открыт модуль интерпретации, заставляющий нас считать, будто мы действуем по собственной свободной воле и сами принимаем важные решения. Автор помещает все это в социальный контекст, а затем приводит нас в зал суда, показывая, какое отношение нейробиология имеет к идее наказания и правосудия.</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий (к обеим книгам).</strong> Обе книги мне кажутся достаточно удачным введением в тему среди многих прочих. Нейронаука в целом имеет самый высокий уровень воспроизводимости среди попавших в кризис воспроизводимости (то есть всё ещё недостаточный). Всё, что известно и представлено в этих книгах, тем не менее, как мне кажется, требует двух мысленных поправок. (1) Большое количество дизайна построено на изучении патологических случаев, иными словами выборки могут быть сильно смещены. (2) Исследования очень дороги, сложны и мультидисциплинарны, поэтому в ближайшие 5-10 лет стоит обратить внимание на революцию в MEG и большие коллаборативные проекты типа openneuro или connectome.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: С позиций современной психологии кажется очевидным тот факт, что IQ-тесты не охватывают весь спектр умственных способностей человека. Они не в состоянии предсказать наш успех в этой жизни и ничего не скажут о нашей способности принимать верные решения в ситуации важного выбора. Но ведь именно правильные решения оказываются ключом к победе, основой самореализации и, в конечном счете, счастья? Кейт Станович занимается проблемами развития человека и прикладной психологии в университете Торонто. Он крупнейший специалист в области психологии, профессор с мировым именем, но он еще и непревзойденный мастер говорить просто о сложных психологических реалиях. В своей книге он не просто подводит итог многолетнему исследованию и демонстрирует, почему высокий интеллект не является залогом мудрости и рационального мышления, но и предлагает альтернативную концепцию измерения «рациональности».</p>

<p><strong>Сегодняшний комментарий:</strong> Популярные книги по психологии, как правило, слишком упрощают материал и работать с ним кроме как с источником полезных инсайтов и ссылок не представляется мне возможным. Если простота — это достоинство, то избыточная простота порой не лучший помощник, поэтому вопреки обыкновению рекомендую у этого же автора вместо этой книги обратить внимание на книгу <em>Rationality and the Reflective Mind</em>. Достоинство данного подхода – тонны психометрии, не в пример powerposes или эмоциональному интеллекту. Недостатки – всё под NDA, и валидировать результаты и методы кому-либо извне не представляется возможным.</p>

<p>Курс Ангера самый внятный из того, что я видел, поскольку в нём хотя бы есть обобщающая нить рассуждения и более-менее универсальный подход к разным ситуациям выбора, а не как это обычно происходит в других учебниках: неоклассика сломалась – давайте починим ещё большим количеством неоклассики. Однако это очень вводный курс, ничего intermediate или выше на этот счёт нет. Остальное больше похоже просто на сборники материалов и именно учебников среди них нет.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: С момента своего появления концепция эвристик и смещений, в том виде в котором она была представлена вплоть до 2000-х, подвергалась критике экономистов не только по идейным причинам, но и за недостаток формальной строгости. Авторы этой фундаментальной коллективной монографии под редакцией Нобелевского лауреата Рейнхарда Зельтена и руководителя института человеческого развития имени Макса Планка Герда Гигеренцера уходят от интерпретации ограниченной рациональности как простого перечня когнитивных особенностей мышления и расширяют ее до рациональных стратегий анализирующих эмоции, социальные нормы, подражания и другие культурные адаптации. Они настаивают: эвристика может быть рациональной стратегией, тонко настраивающей поведение во взаимодействии со средой принятия решений.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: Классическая теория игр, берущая своё начало в 1940-х хорошо подходит для изучения поведения игроков, идеальных в своей рациональности, и потому лишенных человеческих слабостей и эмоциональных реакций. Долгое время такой подход доминировал в литературе, однако он не позволял предсказывать поведение среднестатистического человека в стратегической (игровой) ситуации. Эта книга - первая существенная попытка закрыть этот пробел. Колин Камерер, профессор Калифорнийского технологического института и один из ведущих специалистов в области наук о поведении, представляет поведенческую теорию игр как основной инструмент описания поведения реальных индивидов с опорой на психологические принципы и сотни экспериментов. Автор использует как инструментарий традиционной теории игр, так и психологические и нейробиологические основы принятия решений для построения достоверных моделей экономического поведения человека. Безусловным достоинством книги является доступный и ясный стиль автора, сочетающийся со строгим математическим аппаратом. Книга будет безусловно интересна и полезна всем, кто стремится понять основы стратегического мышления и поведения - студентам, профессиональным экономистам и теоретикам, работающим в областях экономики, бизнеса, психологии, политологии, антропологии и биологии.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: В свое время введение микрооснований в экономические модели стало настоящим прорывом для экономистов. Поведенческая экономическая традиция сделала следующий шаг, и перевела фокус академического внимания на уровень индивидуального поведения. Известный нейрофизиолог и профессор Нью-Йорккого университета Пол Глимчер пошел еще дальше. Он утверждает, что, если вы хотите понять, как работает экономика, нужно понимать, как работает мозг. В этой провокационной книге автор убедительно демонстрирует, что экономическая теория может служить альтернативой классической модели мозга и поведения. В книге также затрагиваются связные вопросы о детерминизме, свободе воли и стохастической природе сложного поведения.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: Нейроэкономика — это новый многообещающий подход к пониманию нейробиологии принятия решений и того, как она влияет на социальные взаимодействия между людьми, обществами, экономиками. Этот подход сочетает в себе нейробиологию, экономику и психологию. До недавнего времени эти дисциплины не пересекались друг с другом, однако в конце XX века экономисты осознали, что важно не только уметь строить строгие математические модели, но еще и учитывать реальное поведение людей. Параллельно с этим нейробиологи также заметили, что изучая поведение мозга в процессе принятия решений, очень удобно пользоваться экономическими терминами. Эта книга стала первым синтетическим изданием, объединяющим усилия специалистов по нейропсихологии, классической когнитивной психологии и поведенческой экономике (включая двух лауреатов Нобелевской премии по экономике) для объяснения того, как люди принимают решения.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: В этой книге подробно изложены результаты исследований теории выбора в экономике с использованием лабораторных животных для изучения потребительского спроса, поведения рынка труда и выбора в условиях неопределенности. Использование лабораторных животных открывает возможность проведения контролируемых экспериментов с хорошо организованными стимулами, которые дополнены точными и требовательными тестами экономической теории. Авторы сравнивают экономические модели выбора с их аналогами из психологии и биологии, попутно сопоставляя их с результатами экспериментов.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: В последние десятилетия поведенческая экономика коренным образом изменила взгляд экономистов на мир, сочетая в себе знания из психологии, социологии и экономики она стала для исследователя незаменимым инструментом объяснения решений, плохо согласующихся с традиционной экономической теорией. Но, несмотря на общий успех, поведенческое мышление только начинает проникать в экономические приложения, прежде всего в области финансовой экономики. Питер Даймонд и Ханну Вартиайнен показывают, как можно использовать поведенческие идеи в шести областях, где эти идеи уже оказались полезными, но еще не реализованы на полную силу: экономика общественного сектора, экономика развития, экономика и право, экономика здравоохранения, экономика стимулов и теория организаций.</p>

</ul>

<p>Abstract_rus: В теории некооперативных игр основной исследовательский вопрос заключается в поиске равновесия в играх, под которыми понимаются равновесия Неша и его обобщения. Традиционное объяснение того, когда и почему возникает равновесие является, как правило, результатом анализа и самоанализа игроков в условиях общего знания правил, функций платежей и предпосылок рациональнольного поведения. Как концептуально, так и эмпирически, такой подход сталкивается с рядом сложностей — в частности, он не в состоянии объяснить, откуда игроки все это знают. Книга Дрю Фудеберга и Дэвида Ливайна ищет ответ на этот вопрос: равновесие возникает как результат долгосрочного процесса, в котором ограниченно рациональные игроки ищут («нащупывают») оптимальные стратегии с течением времени. Модели, предлагаемые в работе, закладывают основу теории поиска равновесия, и разрабатывают инструменты для переосмысления традиционных равновесных моделей.</p>

<p>Abstract_rus: Поведенческая экономика как самостоятельная область науки не сразу получила свое признание и права гражданства. То, что это наконец произошло — заслуга авторов работ, включенных в этот сборник. Читатель найдет здесь все самые важные статьи по поведенческой экономике, опубликованные примерно с 1990 года. Среди 25 статей есть как те, что представляют собой новое прочтение уже существующих концепций, так и те, которые являются образцом передовой мысли поведенческой экономики нацеленной на эмпирический и теоретический анализ реального поведения, недоступный в рамках традиционных экономических моделей.</p>

<h3 id="комментарий-к-разделу-1">Комментарий к разделу:</h3>

<p>Как и положено монографиям и справочникам, они будут интересны скорее читателям с узким фокусом из академии (за исключением быть может поведенческой теории игр Камерера). Как ни парадоксально, но большее применение поведенческие подходы находят совсем не в социо\экономических направлениях исследований. Основные потребители это эволююционная биология, инженерные системы, наподобие распределенных систем и интернета вещей, и вообще всё, исключающее сложный поведенческий ответ. В любом случае, в перспективе 15-30 лет многие из данных подходов изменятся до неузнаваемости, поскольку игнорирование computer science литературы и чудовищный перекос в сторону Confirmatory анализа (а следовательно недостаток Exploratory), просто не могут оставить подходы исследований в таком состоянии.</p>

Однако это не совсем корректно: в частности, один из ее основателей, Леонард Сэвидж - утверждал, что было бы смешно использовать его теорию вне такого маленького мира, в котором всегда можно “посмотреть, прежде чем прыгать”. Книга Кена Бинмора представляет обобщенный и более глубокий взгляд на стандартные теории принятия решений в условиях риска и неопределенности, способный объяснить многие парадоксы «рациональности», неразрешимые в рамках традиционного Байесовского подхода. Бинмор - один из самых глубоких исследователей принятия решений, обсуждает различные философские установки, связанные с природой вероятности, предлагает решения многих парадоксов рациональности. Книга не проста для чтения, однако она станет отличным путеводителем для тех, кому необходим краткий и профессиональный взгляд на проблему принятия решений.</p>

<h3 id="комментарий-к-разделу-3">Комментарий к разделу:</h3>

<p>С монографиями ситуация схожая с учебникам, наиболее интересные результаты, например матчинга, аукционов и прочего, сильно недопредставлены (и недоизучены). В противном случае, мы бы уже увидели широко используемый “Experimental mechanism design”, но его нет. Field experiments (которых нет в изначальном перечне), изучены лучше, но сфокусированы вокруг девелпмента, образования и автоматизированных корпоративных экспериментов (aka AB tests), то есть везде, где интервенции рассматриваются исключительно в контексте оценки линейного эффекта от одного воздействия (редко больше, и совсем редко пересекающиеся эффекты). В результате, ни о какой “тонкой подстройке/настройке” и социальном инжиниринге речь не идёт. Там, где механизмы удачны, например в английском аукционе, все до сих пор спорят почему такой же с точки зрения дизайна аукцион второй цены приводит к иным результатам, а главное, как это можно перенастроить. Дополнительно упомяну здесь не вошедшие в данный перечень книги именно по Field experiments за авторством Duflo&amp;Banerjee, Gerber&amp;Green, Kohavi&amp;Tang&amp;Xu и List (по авторам легко ищутся). У них своя специфика, связанная, например, с эффектами, отложенными во времени, или связанными с масштабированием пилотных исследований и прочитать их полезно, но вышеизложенные проблемы в них не решаются.</p>

<h1 id="общий-комментарий-чего-нет">Общий комментарий (чего нет):</h1>

<p>Знакомясь с литературой, я по неопытности думал, что если есть, например, раздел “экспериментальная экономика”, то всё, что касается двух этих вещей по отдельности (экономика – микроэкономика/десижн, экспериментальная – эпирич. методы), уже хорошо описано и разработано, и ошибся по обоим пунктам. При первом знакомстве литература в данной области предствляется целостной. Однако, если смотреть на нее уже после прохождения аспирантуры, то не хватает существенных областей, особенно важных, если вы исследуете поведение. Нет decision theory, за исключением той, которая была написана под очень специальные фреймворки, наподобие избегания риска. Нет последовательного введения в эпирические методы и ограничения. Нет всего, что касается воспроизводимости и иерархии источников информации. Отсутствует и ветка про неэкономический causal inference. Таким образом, книги по экспериментальной и поведенческой экономике содержат отдельные полезные темы, но в целом представляют собой огромное лоскутное одеяло. Поэтому, пока мой курс про это в процессе создания, напишу коротко последовательность прочтения, которую сам нашел полезной для введения в методы экспериментальной экономики и экспериментов.</p>

<p>Хочу поделиться методом, который выработался за годы работы с неформальными командами и некоммерческими объединениями, и который частично вдохновлен идеей прижизненного эпикриза Канемана. Суть метода: на этапе, когда выполняется экспертиза проектов, я прошу каждого значимого участника нарисовать кривую падения мотивации от времени, а затем сопоставить с этапами выполнения проекта. Обычно это приводит в недоумение.</p>

<p>Что часто требует внимания/объяснения:</p>

<p>(1) Не понимание, что мотивация вообще падает со временем от чего угодно. Решается тем, что мы подбираем похожий проект/занятость человека, и смотрим что было с мотивацией.</p>

<p>(2) Сложность переноса мотивации на временную шкалу. Решается поиском референтных примеров из жизни на разные интервалы времени (когда мотивация падала год, месяц, два дня, или до сих пор поддерживается).</p>

<p>(3) Сложность в наложении разных кривых. Решается тем, что, всех участников просим поделить свое состояние на категории (например их 6: высокая мотивация, умеренная, выше среднего, средняя, пониженная, отсутствие/низкая), а дальше получается кусочно-линейные промежутки, с которыми просто работать.</p>

<p>Rule of thumb здесь такое что время отведенное проекту, должно быть меньше чем время когда у 60% участников ожидается просадка мотивации более чем в половину. Обычно работает как очень отрезвляющий метод и большую часть плохо собранных проектов отсеивает на раз просто потому, что участники сами видят, что командная работа не взлетит.</p>

<p>Не пробовал внутри коммерческой проекторной деятельности, но думаю, что внутренняя мотивация там, тоже часть топлива для работы компании. Буду рад примерами использования, в комментариях.</p>
