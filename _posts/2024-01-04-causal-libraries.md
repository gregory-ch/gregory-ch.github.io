Having recently done a [review of libraries on causality](https://lnkd.in/eQjKMMnM), I have the impression that Microsoft's option is the most viable among others, since it has technical support, promotion and community support. However, I am not mostly a big fan of this "specify all the parameters you can and step aside" approach.

So I was surprised to find at one of the [conferences](https://lnkd.in/eq8YTnK4) a plausible alternative approach, which the authors themselves call "Causal probabilistic programming without tears". Unlike learners, this py-library allows you to customize a lot of things related to estimation and tests and control the process to a much greater extent, so for anyone with an econometric or statistical background I highly recommend it.
