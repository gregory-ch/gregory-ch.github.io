<b>Abstract:</b>  For well-informed decision-making and precise predictions, the ability to discern causality is imperative. An innate understanding of cause-and-effect relationships in daily life can be deceptive and lead to incorrect interpretations of correlations between variables.  While inferring causal-effect relationships from data, individuals must navigate multiple conceptual layers, including causal identification, probabilistic inference, and learning. We present a novel testing framework that mitigates the influence of these latter two components. Specifically, we aim to understand how combinations of observational and intervention data sources could result in incorrect causal conclusions. Additionally, we explore the contributing factors to susceptibility to biases when individuals attempt to answer causal queries using data. In our framework, participants face repeated tasks with data generation processes (DGP) of varying structures with three variables that they should deduce by examining the data. We found that participants' accuracy levels marginally exceeded random guessing, with only a 10-25 percent improvement. This accuracy is determined by the type of data source (observational or interventional) and does not align with purely algorithmic complexity of DGP. These findings carry significant implications for both causal cognition literature and cognitive economics. They shed light on forming causal mental models and could inform the development of educational tools and strategies to improve critical thinking and analytical skills, particularly in contexts where causal reasoning is essential.
